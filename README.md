# What is FastDJ

FastDJ is a simple script that helps you to create your restful api django backend project easily.  
What you do with djangorestframework is pretty limited, therefore FastDJ offers some templates to do them quickly, and you can use them just with some modify at the settings file.

# What FastDJ offers

- making models
- automatically installing required pip modules (django, djangorestframework, django-cors-headers)
- easier setups in settings.py ( simplify the setups about timezone, adding django_apps, restframework settings and cors-headers settings )
- setting up serializers
- making custom user model with templates
- limited templates about views
- auto url routing
